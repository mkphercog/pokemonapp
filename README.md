# Pokemon APP

This application uses website https://pokeapi.co/ to fetch data about pokemons. I learned here how to build pagination and good way to fetch data ( in my opinion :) ). Also it's my first small aplication styled with styled-components.

## If you want you can copy this app, for that use command:

```
git clone https://github.com/mkphercog/pokemonapp.git
```

### After that in cloned folder use:

```
npm install
```

## In this project I'm using:

- react (CRA)
- styled-components
- react-router
- redux
- typescript

## See my pokemon app here:
